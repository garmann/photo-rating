# photo-rating

## description
this is a quick project setup / prototype. its a simple SPA written in angularjs with a rest api as backend called: photo-rating-api (see my side repo on github: https://github.com/garmann/photo-rating-api).

i wanted to create a spa to rate photos of my shootings. with this app i can save a lot of time which is usually consumned by communication. my photo-model can rate its favorites. i can grab this informations in paste the favorites into my lightroom filter.

usually i takes some emails and phone calls to sort this out. with this app, we can share a link, rate the photos, start editing in lightroom and finally upload them. my photo-model can always download the images as single image download or as zip file (full shooting).

## setup
- see package.json... and npm install`

## running it

- npm start

this app runs at port 8000
